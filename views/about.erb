<h3>About This Site</h3>
<p>
  

Card Smith is an online card generator that was created to allow creative Magic: The Gathering players to easily and rapidly create cards and share concept visualizations. Since inception in May 2011, we have added support for complex card concepts, Planeswalkers, and Token card creation. In addition, we have continued to engage the community for ideas, resulting in member accounts, tools and new functionality since launch.
