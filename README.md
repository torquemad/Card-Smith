###About:
I love both board games and card games, and often find that  my friends and I are wanting to tweak the games we play with our own rules, artwork and stories.

I built Card-Smith with the idea that people can make their own trading card games, by defining their own story, rules, and building their cards from scratch with their favourite artwork.

At the moment, this is sci-fi themed.

###Future plans:

This app was built in 4 days, and unfortunatly doesn't perform very well on mobile (sorry!), but I do plan to revisit this in the future to add extra features and tweak the design.

- Authenticated users can make their own game from scratch (story, rules, etc)
- Multiple card templates (not just sci-fi themed)
- Responsive design
- Downloadable cards (.jpg or bundle to .pdf)
- Re-design individual cards to fit text better (buggy atm)
